# Airline
### The airline has a list of flights for which it is necessary to implement:
- search for a flight by number;
- selection of a flight by the parameters 'From', 'Where', 'Date of departure';
- sorting flights by number, name.
- The dispatcher create the flight crew for the flight (pilots, navigator, radio operator, stewwardess) and manages the flight status. In case of problems with the formation team, the dispatcher can send request to the Administrator.
### The administrator manages (it should be possible to add, delete, edit):
* a list of flights (can add / remove a flight, edit information about it);
* list of personnel (can add / remove an employee, edit information about him).
* The administrator considers the dispatcher's requests and closes them with one of the statuses (completed, rejected).
